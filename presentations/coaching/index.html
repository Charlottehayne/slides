        </header>
        <p>This OTS coaching style has its root in the <a href="http://curriculum.railsbridge.org/workshop/teacher_training">RailsBridge teaching style.</a> As such it is very focussed on creating a friendly and open environment for learners of all sorts.</p>
        <p>How to achieve this and have a pleasant learning experience is focus of this presentation.</p>

          <h2>The Material</h2>
        </header>
        <p>We strongly believe the best way to learn to code - or any other tech related topic for that matter - is by hands-on, experience oriented and pragmatic workshop worked through on ones own pace. Our curricula are designed for exactly that purpose.</p>
        <p>That is also reflected in the way we organise ourself on sight: there is no class-room-style setting, everyone has their own workspace instead. There is no teacher in front and there is no one going through the material with a presenter.</p>

          <h2>Coaching ain't Teaching</h2>
        </header>
        <p>In that regard we are not standing in front and teach here. Coaches</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>stand by on the sideline</li>
            <li>are right there when needed</li>
            <li>focus on the learners</li>
            <li>have sympathy for their abilities</li>
            <li>encourage to go further through motivation</li>
            <li>and ensure one has fun doing it.</li>
